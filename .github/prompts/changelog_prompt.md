**GENERATION INSTRUCTIONS:**

Now I will provide you with raw release notes data. Please process this data and generate a complete changelog file based on the template above.

**Processing Requirements:**
1. Analyze each item in the release notes data
2. Categorize items based on their content:
   - Code additions/new functionality → New Features
   - Error corrections/patches → Bug Fixes  
   - Performance improvements/optimizations → Enhancements
   - README/documentation changes → Documentation
   - Package updates/version bumps → Dependencies
   - First-time contributors → New Contributors
   - Automated dependency updates → Dependabot Updates

3. Transform raw descriptions into clear, professional language
   - **EXCEPTION**: For Dependabot updates, preserve the original commit message formatting exactly as-is
   - Dependabot commits should maintain their "Bump [package] from [old-version] to [new-version]" format
4. Ensure proper markdown formatting
5. Only include sections that have actual content (omit empty sections)
6. Use appropriate emojis as shown in templates
7. Maintain consistent bullet point formatting
8. For Dependabot Updates section: Keep original "Bump [package] from [version] to [version]" format with PR links

**Output Format:**
- Generate the English version first
- Then add exactly '--------' as a separator
- Output ONLY the markdown content, no other text
- Do not include template comments/guidelines in the final output

**Quality Standards:**
- Each bullet point should be a complete, clear statement
- Use active voice and specific action verbs
- Include relevant technical details when helpful
- Maintain professional tone throughout
