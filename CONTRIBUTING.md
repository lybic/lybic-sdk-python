# How to contribute

Thank you so much for wanting to contribute to Lybic Project! Here are a few important things you should know about contributing:

1. API changes require discussion, use cases, etc. Code comes later.
2. Pull requests are great for small fixes for bugs, documentation, etc.
3. Pull requests are not merged directly into the master branch, please use the `develop` branch.

## API changes

If your changes involve alterations to the existing apis of the SDK, please **carefully consider** what you are doing.

Because the changes you make may have an impact on our developers.

If you're interested in seeing a new feature in Lybic(or the underlying services), the best approach is to create an [issue](https://github.com/lybic/lybic-sdk-python/issues) (or comment on an existing issue if there is one) requesting the feature and describing specific use cases for it.

If the feature has merit, it will go through a thorough process of API design and review. Any code should come after this.

## Pull requests

Unless the change is a trivial fix such as for a typo, it's generally best to start by opening a new issue describing the bug or feature you're intending to fix. 

Even if you think it's relatively minor, it's helpful to know what people are working on. And as mentioned above, API changes should be discussed thoroughly before moving to code.

Some examples of types of pull requests that are immediately helpful:

- Fixing a bug without changing a public API.
- Fixing or improving documentation.
- Improvements to set-up configuration.
